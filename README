A professional grade web framework in Julia - at very early stage, a lot more left to do, not usable yet. 

Done so far: Database low level abstraction layer on top of Postgres, ORM, Migrations, Tasks runner, Tests runner, Logging, Controllers, extended routing based on Mux
Left to do: the view layer, asset management, and probably swap Mix with HttpServer + Router
